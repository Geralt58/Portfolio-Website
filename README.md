# Portfolio-Website
A sample Portfolio Website I made with the help of tutorials to learn Sass.

To run and edit the file in your local repository, open the root folder in your terminal and use 'npm install' to install the node modules. Then use 'npm run sass' to make changes to the webpages.
The link to the website can be found in the repository description.
