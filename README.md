# Portfolio-Website
A sample Portfolio Website I made with the help of tutorials to learn Sass.

To run the file in your local repository, open the root folder in your terminal and use 'npm install' to install the node modules. Then use 'npm run dev-server' to host the dev server and use 'npm run build' to build the production files.
The link to the website can be found in the repository description.
